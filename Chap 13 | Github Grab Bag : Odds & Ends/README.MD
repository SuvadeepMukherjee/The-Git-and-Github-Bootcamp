# Chap 13 | Github Grab Bag : Odds & Ends

## README files

1. A README file is used to communicate important information about a repository including:
   - What the project does
   - How to run the project
   - Why it's noteworthy
   - Who maintains the project
2. If you put a README in the **root** of your project, Github will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page
3. READMEs are **Markdown** files, ending with the `.md` extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text
4. Useful websites
   - [Markdown documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
   - [Markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/)

## Github Gists

1. Github Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others
2. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical Github repository
3. [Discover gists](https://gist.github.com/discover)

## Github Pages

1. [Gitub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are public webpages that are hosted and published via Github. They allow you to **create a website** simply by **pushing your code to Github**
2. Github Pages is a hosting service for **static webpages**, so it does not support server-side code like Python, Ruby, or Node. **Just HTML/CSS/JS**!
3. User Site
   - **One** user site per Github account
   - You could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website on it
   - The default url is based on your Github username, following this pattern: `username.github.io` (changeable)
4. Project Sites
   - Each Github repo can have a corresponding hosted website â†’ **unlimited**
   - It's as simple as **telling Github which specific branch** contains the web content
   - The default urls follow this pattern: `username.github.io/repo-name`
