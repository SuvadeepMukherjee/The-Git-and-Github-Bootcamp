#### Q1:How to clone a public Github Repo ? 

**Answer**:

To clone a repo simply run `git clone <url>`

- Git will retreive all the files associated with the repository and will copy them to your local machine
- In addition ,Git initialises a new repository on your machine , giving you access to the full history of the cloned project ➡️make sure you are not in a repo when you clone
- Wherever you run git clone , that is the place where git is going to create a new folder for us
