#### Q1: Why do we need stashing ? 

**Answer**:

Imagine when you switch to other branches with uncommitted files on current branch , what will happen ? 

- My changes come with me to the destination branch (no potiential conflicts)
- Git wont let me switch if it detects potiential conflicts

Stashing ➡️➡️ Git provides an easy way of stashing these uncommitted changes so that we can return to them later 🔥  without having to make unnecessary commits
