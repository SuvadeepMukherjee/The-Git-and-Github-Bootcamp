Anki ‚û°Ô∏è 09-the-ins-and-outs-of-stashing

#### Q1: Why do we need stashing ? 

**Answer**:

Imagine when you switch to other branches with uncommitted files on current branch , what will happen ? 

- My changes come with me to the destination branch (no potiential conflicts)
- Git wont let me switch if it detects potiential conflicts

Stashing ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Git provides an easy way of stashing these uncommitted changes so that we can return to them later üî•  without having to make unnecessary commits   

#### Q2:git stash / git stash pop 

**Answer**:

- *git stash* will take all uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged) and stash them , reverting the changes in our working directory 
- *git stash pop* removes the most recently stashed changes in your stash and re-apply them in your working directory 

#### Q3:git stash apply 

**Answer**:

- We can use git stash apply to apply whatever is stashed away without removing it from the stash 
- This can be useful if we want to apply stashed changes to multiple branches
