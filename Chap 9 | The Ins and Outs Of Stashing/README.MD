# Chap 9 | The Ins and Outs of Stashing 

## Introduction to Stash 

Imagine when you switch to other branches with uncommitted files on current branch , what will happen ? 

- My changes come with me to the destination branch (no potiential conflicts)
- Git wont let me switch if it detects potiential conflicts 

Stashing ➡️➡️ Git provides an easy way of stashing these uncommitted changes so that we can return to them later , without having to make unnecessary commits
